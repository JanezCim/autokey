# Autokey config

Autokey is a shortcut manager in Linux, this is my personal config file for it.

First install autokey

    sudo apt install autokey-gtk

After instalation clone this repo inside autokey config folder

    cd ~/.config/autokey/data
  
You should be able to start autokey from launch window and the config should be automatically imported
